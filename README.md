## GROW YOUR COMMUNITY with the SEEDENGRAVER3000!

**SEEDENGRAVER3000** is a toolkit that allows you to engrave your seed  
with the [Safu Ninja method](https://safu.ninja/) in a cool and *Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder-friendly* way.

The idea is to share the toolkit between members of the same [Satoshi Spritz](https://satoshispritz.it/), or groups of trusted people  
who desire to talk about Bitcoin ***and Bitcoin only***.

**What's inside?**  
The toolkit is composed by:

- A solid hammer: 10€
- A padded and waterproof case: 316x195x80 23€
- Waterproof CNC capsule: 5€
- Metal Stamps 36x 33€
- A 3D printed custom blockmit 14€
- An inox Bolt , one inox nut and 28 inox washers 8€ 

**TOT: 92€**

Everything is cost price, because the main goal is to spread safety best practices for everybody.

**Why buy**  
Because you are a member of your local community and want to help your fren.   
Because that's the best way to keep your seed nice and safe.  
Because you're a paranoid.   
Because selling washers and capsules is a good way to stack some no-kyc sats!  
Because you have a OCD disorder and want to store your stuff in a perfectly symmetrical way.  

If your will is to buy it in order to spread this best practice among the plebs, keep in mind that  
you'll need to replace all items used like the hardware and the capsule with new one.  
You can find those to your local hardware shop for few fiatcoin.  
Remember to buy all inox hardware.
